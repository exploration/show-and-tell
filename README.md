# ShowAndTell

If you've ever had Rails forms with front-end logic that shows or hides form values conditionally on what's entered on the form, and then back-end validation that mirrors that logic, then boy do we have a gem for you!

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'show_and_tell'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install show_and_tell

## Usage

TODO: Write usage instructions here

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake test` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
