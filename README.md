# ShowAndTell

If you've ever had Rails forms with front-end logic that shows or hides form values conditionally on what's entered on the form, and then back-end validation that mirrors that logic, then boy do we have a gem for you!

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'show_and_tell'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install show_and_tell

## Usage

### Class Setup
Say you have a class named `FineCheese`. You want to set it up so that if the field `cheese` is given the value "brie", you want to show the `age` field. When `cheese` matches "cheddar", you want to validate the presence of the `origin` field. When `cheese` matches "nacho" you want to both show, and validate the presence of the `origin` field.

When the `age` field is anything above 40 years, you want to validate the presence of the `moldiness` field.

Here's how you set that up:

```ruby
class FineCheese
  include ActiveModel::Model
  include ShowAndTell

  attr_accessor :age, :cheese, :moldiness, :origin

  validates_presence_of :cheese

  form_option :cheese do |f|
    f.show_when_matches 'brie', :age

    f.tell_when_matches 'cheddar',
      origin: 'Kindly indicate the cheddar country'

    f.show_and_tell_when_matches 'nacho',
      origin: 'Country plz on yer nacho chz'
  end

  form_option :age do |f|
    f.tell_when_matches '[4-9]\d+', moldiness: 'oooh, how moldy is it?'
  end
end
```

### Javascript Front-End

To use the Javascript front-end, you'll need to add the following to your `app/assets/javascripts/application.js` file:

```javascript
//= require show_and_tell
```

Then, in your HTML, probably in the header just before the body:

```html
<script>
  const show_and_tell = new ShowAndTell
</script>
```

And at the bottom of every form that you wish to monitor, you can insert the magic incantation to inject monitoring:

```html
<%= show_and_tell_register FineCheese %>
```

... where `FineCheese` is the class name of the form being monitored (for example, `ParentCommentForm` or `CourseForm`, etc.).

For each field you monitor, you'll want to enclose everything you wish to show/hide in a `sat-field` node of some sort. For example:

```html
<div sat-field="cheese">
  Cheese:
  <label>
    <input type="radio" name="cheese" value="brie" />
    Brie
  </label>
  <label>
    <input type="radio" name="cheese" value="nacho" />
    Nacho
  </label>            
</div>
<div sat-field="age">
  <label>
    Age:
    <input type="text" />
  </label>
</div>
<!-- etc. -->
```

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake test` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
